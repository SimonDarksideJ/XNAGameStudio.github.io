# Ziggyware Archived Articles

From the awesome Ziggyware site that was a long supporter of game developers, and especially XNA devs.

You can still revisit Ziggy using the WayBack machine here:

## C++ Articles

|Title|Description|
|-|-|
|[Advanced Polygon Clipping](AdvancedPolygonClipping)|Some times you need to split a polygon across a plane boundary. This is useful when doing a splitting OCTree or BSP tree|
|[Calculating CRC 32](CalculatingCRC32)|Here is source code for calculating the CRC 32 (32 bit Cyclic Redundancy Check) value of a given 32 bit number|
|[Calculating Tangents and Binormals/Bitangents](CalculatingTangentsandBinormals-Bitangents)|Tangents and binormals are used in advanced shaders like parallax mapping.<br/>Check out the source below to see how you can calculate these values given a vertex buffer and vertex declaration (DX9)|
|[Converting Vertex Buffer Formats](ConvertingVertexBufferFormats)|Converting vertex buffers from one format to another is useful when you need to add more UV coordinates or tangent and binormals to a vertex buffer|
|[Critical Sections (Multithreading)](CriticalSections(Multithreading))|Here is a simple implementation of a locked variable that can be used between two threads without worrying about the memory being garbaged up with simultaneous writes|
|[Data Vector](DataVector)|Here is a simple data vector template that can be used to store a chunk of memory|
|[Decomposing a matrix](Decomposingamatrix)|Matrix decomposition is very useful when you would like to get the translation, scale or rotation from a matrix. This should not be done very often however since it is an expensive operation|
|[Delegates in C++](DelegatesinC++)|Delegates are function pointer containers that are used as a generic form of holding function pointers|
|[Easy XML Editing in C++](EasyXMLEditinginC++)|By using your own XML classes instead of those provided by MSXML you can get more readable code and reliability when manipulating complex XML data|
|[Faster Matrix Identity](FasterMatrixIdentity)|By using MMX we can increase the speed of a matrix identity operation|
|[Faster new and delete](Fasternewanddelete)|Below is a way you can get alot more bang for your buck when using new and delete|
|[Finite State Machines](FiniteStateMachines)|Finite State Machines are used to keep the state of a system of objects. In game development they can be used to make your engine event driven|
|[Frustum Culling](FrustumCulling)|In order to speed up the rendering of your game you need to use frustum culling.<br/>Frustum culling is just a fancy word for making your game engine not render objects that are not visible to the camera|
|[Linked List template class](LinkedListtemplateclass)|Here is an implementation of a list class|
|[Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) Collision](OrientedBoundingBox(OBB)Collision)|Here is my implementation of OBB collision between two oriented bounding boxes|

|[Simple MP3 Player](SimpleMP3Player)|Playing an MP3 file with DirectX|
|[Skip List Template](SkipListTemplate)|Skip lists are used to store large amounts of data in a sorted collection of lists. There is a very low cost for inserting and removing nodes from the skip list|
|[TCP Socket Implementation](TCPSocketImplementation)|Simple walk-though creating TCP sockets|

|-|-|
|[C# Introduction](C#Introduction)|A simple introduction to programming in C#|
|[Advanced Sockets Implementation in C#](AdvancedSocketsImplementationinC#)|Socket programming in C# is much easier than it is in c/c++. Here we use attributes and reflection to re-create and populate incoming packets|
