# Using quaternions for rotations - dynamically positioning the camera behind our xwing

In this chapter, we are going to make our xwing fly around the city. Of course, this is not as easy as telling the thing to fly, we will need to reposition it ourselves and to make the camera track the xwing.

## Camera theory

Imagine our xwing was flying through our 3D city, we would like our camera to follow our xwing so that the camera would always be positioned behind the xwing, no matter which rotation or translation our xwing has.

To start to implement this, we are going to introduce two new variables, **xwingPosition** and **xwingRotationg**. These variables will determine the position and rotation of our camera relative to the xwing, in order to follow the xwing as it moves/rotates.

We could store the rotation of our xwing as separate rotations around the X, Y, and Z axis, however, in practice this is very tricky. The problem is mainly the same as with matrices, a rotation around X followed by a rotation around Y does NOT yield the same as a rotation around Y followed by a rotation around X.  In addition, deriving the total rotation from three separate values requires some trigonometric formulae (sin, cos, tan,…) and sometimes these suddenly switch signs, which would make our xwing fly backwards.

To solve both problems we will be using a Quaternion to store the rotation of our xwing. A Quaternion is very similar to a Matrix, but it can only store a rotation. Do not let the name of this thing scare you away (although it is very hard to understand mathematically), a quaternion is VERY easy to use. 

Go ahead and declare these 2 variables at the top of your code:

```csharp
    private Vector3 _xwingPosition = new Vector3(8, 1, -3);
    private Quaternion _xwingRotation = Quaternion.Identity;
```

As you can see, we have already initialized the starting position and rotation for our xwing, in the next chapter we will see how we can adjust the quaternion based on user input, for now, use the quaternion identity (which is the same as a Zero rotation).

## positioning the xwing

To accomplish the goal of this chapter, we will draw the 3D city and then draw the xwing in its correct position and rotation, then, we will reposition the camera immediately behind our plane.

In our **DrawModel** method we already change the world matrix for our xwing so that it is drawn at the correct location, so let us update it to also update it with the correct rotation (and the new Position variable):

```csharp
    Matrix worldMatrix = Matrix.CreateScale(0.0005f, 0.0005f, 0.0005f) *
                         Matrix.CreateRotationY(MathHelper.Pi) *
                         Matrix.CreateFromQuaternion(_xwingRotation) *
                         Matrix.CreateTranslation(_xwingPosition);
```

This line looks complex, but it is quite easy:

* First, the mesh is translated (=moved) to its correct position.
* Next, the xwing is rotated among the rotation stored in the xwingRotation quaternion.
* After this, it is rotated along 180 degrees to compensate for the opposite direction stored inside the model.
* And finally, the model is scaled down so it fits nicely in our scene.

> Remember, the lines in a transformation are calculated from back to front.

From here, you can easily see how easy it is to retrieve the rotation matrix corresponding translated from a quaternion using the **Matrix.CreateFromQuaternion** function.

## Translating the camera

Now that we have our xwing at the correct position and correctly rotated, it is time to position the camera behind the xwing. We are going to create a new **UpdateCamera** method to do this. Our method will create a new **viewMatrix** and **projectionMatrix** that depend on the current position and rotation of the xwing.

Let us start with this:

```csharp
    private void UpdateCamera()
    {
        Vector3 cameraPosition = new Vector3(0, 0.1f, 0.6f);
    }
```

This vector will define where we want our camera to be, relative to the position of the xwing (called an offset).  We want to position the camera a bit behind (Z=+0.6f) and above (Y=+0.1f) to our xwing, so the vector only has a Y and Z component. This vector still needs to be transformed as it needs to be translated (= moved) to the position behind our mesh, and then it needs to be rotated (aligned) with the rotation of the xwing, so that it will end up nicely behind the xwing.

Let us first process the rotation transform by adding the following to the new **UpdateCamera** method:

```csharp
    cameraPosition = Vector3.Transform(cameraPosition, Matrix.CreateFromQuaternion(xwingRotation));
```

Now the **cameraPosition** variable holds a vector that will always be behind (and a bit above) our xwing no matter what its rotation is, if the xwing is in the (0,0,0) position. Because the position of our xwing will constantly change, we also need to move (=translate) our cameraPosition vector to the position of our xwing, which is done using the following line:

```csharp
    cameraPosition += _xwingPosition;
```

OK, so now we have the vector that will always be a bit behind and a bit above our xwing, no matter which rotation and/or translation our xwing has!

## Keeping the camera up to date

Remember, when we create a viewMatrix, we not only need the position and target of our camera (which we both know at this moment), but also the vector that indicates the ‘up’-position of the xwing. This is found exactly the same way, we start with the vector that points up and rotate it with the xwing rotation matrix:

```csharp
    Vector3 cameraUpDirection = new Vector3(0, 1, 0);
    cameraUpDirection = Vector3.Transform(cameraUpDirection, Matrix.CreateFromQuaternion(_xwingRotation));
```

Now we have everything we need to create our camera matrices, the position, target, and up-vector. So by adding the following, we can create our new matrices:

```csharp
    _viewMatrix = Matrix.CreateLookAt(cameraPosition, _xwingPosition, cameraUpDirection);
    _projectionMatrix = Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(MathHelper.PiOver4, _device.Viewport.AspectRatio, 0.2f, 500.0f);
```

Only the first line contains the newly created vectors, the second line has remained the same (but we apply it anyway, just to be sure).

Quite a method, but we also need to make sure we call it from the **Update** method, this will cause both camera matrices to be updated according to the latest position or rotation of the xwing!

```csharp
    protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
    {
        if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed ||
            Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Escape))
            Exit();

        // TODO: Add your update logic here
        UpdateCamera();

        base.Update(gameTime);
    }
```

That is it! When you run this code, you’ll see the camera has been positioned behind and above your xwing, as on the image below:

![Camera View](https://github.com/simondarksidej/XNAGameStudio/raw/archive/Images/Riemers/3DXNA2-07Camera1.jpg?raw=true)

Now we have our code ready so the camera is adjusted automatically to the xwingPosition and xwingRotation variables, it is time to read the keyboard. Anyway, we now have a dynamic camera that follows our xwing, no matter what its position and rotation is.

## Exercises

You can try these exercises to practice what you have learned:

* Change the position of the xwing and you will see that the camera follows!
