# Riemer's MonoGame Tutorials for C# -- Series 2

Welcome to this second series of MonoGame for C# Tutorials! In the first series, you learned some basic features of MonoGame. This set of features will be further expanded in this series, so after completing this series you'll have created your own 3D game!!

In this second series of MonoGame for C# Tutorials, you'll learn how to create a complete flight simulator. This will include flying your aircraft in a true 3D city and firing bullets at objects! Here’s a sample screenshot of what you’ll create:

Again, the main goal of this series is to cover MonoGame features. This means the physical flight model will not contain gravity influences, it will just let you maneuver your aircraft.

## This is a list of the features you'll learn in this second series of MonoGame Tutorials

- Adding textures to your triangles
- Dynamically generating the 3D city environment
- Adding the skybox to get rid of the black background
- Basic, but accurate flight modeling
- Camera movement
- Point sprites, basic billboarding
- Alpha blending

During this series you will need to download the [asset pack](https://github.com/SimonDarksideJ/XNAGameStudio/raw/archive/Samples/Riemers/3D%20Series2%20-%20FlightSim%20-%20Assets.zip?raw=true) which contains the following resources:

- Starting Effect file: effects.fx
- Textures: riemerstexture.bmp
- Loading the floorplan: texturemap.jpg
- Loading a Model: xwing.x
- Adding targets: target.x
- Point sprites: bullet.jpg
- Skybox: skybox.x
- Skybox: skyboxtextures (6 images)
