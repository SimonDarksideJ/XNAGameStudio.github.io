# MonoGame Tutorial for C# overview – Series 1

This part of the series will show you just how easy it is to get a 3D game using MonoGame up and running!. This tutorial is aimed at people who have not done any 3D programming and would like to see some results in the shortest possible time, to this end, MonoGame is an ideal programming environment. Using C# as the programming language, the code looks very much like Java, so anyone having some notions of Java should be able to start right away. Even more, this tutorial is written in such a way that anyone who has any programming experience should be able to understand and complete it!

> If you have not done so already, I recommend working your way through the 2D series to familiarize yourself with some of the fundamentals of MonoGame projects:

This first series of MonoGame tutorials gives you a general introduction to building 3D projects with MonoGame and is divided into several chapters, which you can find listed below. 

## Chapters

In every chapter you will learn the basic features of MonoGame:

1. [Starting a project: setting up and using the Development Environment](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain01starting)
2. [The effect file: effects are needed to draw stuff on the screen](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain02effect)
3. [The first triangle: defining points, displaying them using MonoGame](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain03triangles)
4. [World space: defining points in 3D space, defining camera position](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain04worldspace)
5. [Rotation & translation: rotating and moving the scene](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain05rotation)
6. [Indices: removing redundant vertex information to decrease AGP/PCIX bandwidth](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain06indices)
7. [Terrain basics: bringing altitude into our program](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain07terrainbasics)
8. [Terrain from file: create a terrain from an image file](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain08terrainfile)
9. [Keyboard: read user input on the keyboard using MonoGame](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain09keyboard)
10. [Adding colors: add simple color to you terrain](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain10colors)
11. [Lighting basics: lighting can be complex to fully understand, a whole chapter on this subject](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain11lighting)
12. [Terrain lighting: making use of what we learned in the previous chapter to enable lighting over our terrain](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain12terrainlighting)
13. [Improving performance by using VertexBuffers and IndexBuffers](Riemers3DXNA1Terrain13buffers)
