## Description

This sample shows how to load and process a custom animation for an avatar by using the XNA Framework Content Pipeline.

## Sample Overview

You'll learn how to load a custom animation from an FBX file exported from an avatar rig, and then use a custom content processor to extract the animation data from the exported file and save it as a CustomAvatarAnimationData object. At this point, the animation data can then be loaded at runtime and played back by using the CustomAvatarAnimationPlayer.

Five custom animations from the new Animation Asset Pack are included with this sample to demonstrate the playback in action.
