## Sample Overview

Inverse kinematics is a programmatic solution to controlling the animation of rigged models. When artists generate an animated model for a game, the animations created by the artists won't necessarily work for every position in the world. For example, if an artist were to create an animation of a character pressing a button, the animation would only work so long as the button was always at the same position relative to the model. If the button were to be moved up or down the pre-made model, the animation would have no way to account for that. Using inverse kinematics, the button in the example can be placed anywhere and the model will animate to reach it.
