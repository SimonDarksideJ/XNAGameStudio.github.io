## Sample Overview

Occasionally, you may want the avatars in your game to interact with other objects in the world. For example, perhaps you want your avatar to hold a baseball bat. In order to draw the baseball bat in the correct location, you need to know the world space location at which to place the bat. This sample demonstrates how to find the world space transform that is needed to draw a baseball bat in the avatar's right hand.
