## Sample Overview

Part of the beauty of Windows Phone 7 is its Back key functionality, which makes it easy for users to step back through a stack of previously loaded applications and application pages. However, this functionality comes at a cost for the application developer, who must understand how the page stack operates in Silverlight for Windows Phone, and how to manipulate that stack in an optimal manner.

The Non-Linear Navigation Service is a Windows Phone Recipe that provides the building blocks and instructional material that you need to manage these tasks. It includes a full set of compilable sample code that you can use in your own applications. It provides back stack management so that you don't have to perform this task yourself in your application code.
