## Sample Overview

This sample demonstrates how to blend between two animations over a fixed period of time. Once a new animation is selected by the user, the new target animation is blended into the current animation over a period of 0.25 seconds.

The AvatarAnimation object enables developers to play one of the built-in animations on an AvatarRenderer. When you switch animations, the positions of the avatar's arms and legs can quickly snap to the new animation positions. Blending between the two animations can smooth out this transition.
