## Description

This sample demonstrates basic artificial intelligence navigation in 2D, using waypoints

## Sample Overview

When programming the AI for your game, you often want your actors to follow a path that you supply. For example, you may want units in your real-time strategy game to follow orders, or perhaps you want to make a mouse navigate a maze.

This sample uses a tank to demonstrate two examples of this waypoint-following behavior. In this sample, you can move the cursor around and add waypoints toward which the tank will move in the order that you add them.
