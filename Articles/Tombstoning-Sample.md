## Sample Overview

To help ensure that the user experience is fast and responsive, Windows Phone prioritizes the application running in the foreground and will typically tombstone an application when the user navigates away. If your application is reactivated after being tombstoned, it's important to restore the visual state of your application so that the user experience is that of returning to a running application. It's also important that application state be restored in a way that doesn't delay the load time of the application. This sample shows how to restore the visual state of a page and also restore application data when an application is reactivated after tombstoning.
