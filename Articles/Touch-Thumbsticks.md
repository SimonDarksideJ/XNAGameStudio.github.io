## Description

This sample demonstrates a technique for using the touch panel to provide thumbstick-style controls for a game.

## Sample Overview

The sample contains a simple shooter game controlled by holding the phone in landscape orientation, and by using two sides of the screen as thumbsticks. The class that implements the thumbstick logic is segregated for easy reuse in other games using the same control scheme.
