## Description

This tutorial will teach you how to extend the Skinned Model sample by directly accessing and manipulating the positions of specific bones to add three new features:

    Overriding the position of selected bones from your C# code, so the head or arm can be rotated independently of the rest of the animation
    Positioning an object relative to an animated bone, so the character can hold a baseball bat
    Attaching a set of bounding spheres to the animated character, which can be used for collision detection

If you want to jump straight to the end result, the final code produced by following this tutorial can be found in the SkinnedModelExtensions subfolder.
