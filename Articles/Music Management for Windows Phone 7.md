## Sample Overview

To be accepted into the Windows Phone Marketplace, apps and games must meet the Windows Phone Certification Requirements. The requirements around music playback in games can be particularly tricky, especially when responding to external events that require pausing the music.

To help your games meet these requirements, this sample provides a BackgroundMusicManager class that encapsulates the functionality necessary to safely and reliably play, stop, and resume music in your game, while automatically responding to phone events.
