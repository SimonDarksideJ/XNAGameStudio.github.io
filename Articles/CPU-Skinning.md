## Description

This sample shows how to skin a model (the process of applying a model's skin to its bone structure) on the CPU. Typically, it would be far more beneficial to perform this work on the GPU, but the unique architecture of the Windows Phone actually sees drastic performance increases when skinning is off-loaded to the CPU.

Important While the emulator mimics the functionality of the Windows Phone, it doesn't mimic all aspects of the Windows Phone architecture. This means that the performance gains from skinning on the CPU can't be seen without a device.
