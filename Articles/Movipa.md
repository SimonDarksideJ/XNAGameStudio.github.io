## Description

Movipa is a complete game for XNA Game Studio. The project comes ready to compile and run, and it's easy to customize with a little bit of C# programming. You are also free to use the source code as the basis for your own XNA Game Studio game projects, and to share your work with others.

Movipa is a puzzle game involving moving images that demonstrates the following components:

* Non-continuous rendering of puzzle tiles via texture coordinates
* Asynchronous asset loading
* Game state saving and loading
* Multiple gameplay modes
* Complex scene-description system for layered 2D scenes.
* Skinned animation system, from the Skinning Animation sample.
