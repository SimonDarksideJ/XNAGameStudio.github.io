## Description

This sample demonstrates how to implement a variety of screen-space distortion effects with a general post-processing technique.

## Sample Overview

The techniques shown here are an invisibility cloak, heat haze, and privacy glass. The effect is extremely flexible and can be tuned for everything from explosion shockwaves to full-screen underwater vision perturbation.
