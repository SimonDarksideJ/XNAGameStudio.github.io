## Sample Overview

This sample plays back recorded sound with an echo effect applied to it. To use this sample, you must have a microphone enabled on your computer or Xbox 360 console, or you must be using the built-in microphone on the Windows Phone device. Record the audio by speaking into the microphone and listen to your voice played back with an echo effect. You may need to adjust the volume or wear headphones to prevent feedback between the speaker and microphone, especially on Windows Phone.
