## Sample Overview

This sample expands on the Bing Maps sample capabilities by combining the Pathfinding sample to enable the tank to drive to markers around the screen by using the streets on the map. The sample presents a navigable map of the world by accessing the Bing Maps REST services.

The sample also enables you to switch between street and aerial view, switch between walking and driving navigation, add and remove markers, and switch the visible location.

Note: This sample requires a Bing Maps key to run. To register and obtain a key, visit https://www.bingmapsportal.com/.
