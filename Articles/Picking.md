## Description

This sample shows how to determine whether a player's cursor is over an object, and how to find out where on the screen an object is.

## Sample Overview

There are several situations in which it can be useful to know the 3D equivalent of a point on the screen, and vice versa: for example, checking to see whether a player has clicked on an object, or drawing text above a player's head. This can be accomplished by using the Project and Unproject methods on the Viewport class. This sample demonstrates the use of these methods.

In the sample, there's a table with several objects on it. If the user moves the cursor over an object, the object's name is drawn.
