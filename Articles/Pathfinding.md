## Description

This sample demonstrates how AIs can use algorithms to navigate a map by using three common pathfinding routines.

## Sample Overview

To create realistic enemy movement by using AI, implementing Pathfinding algorithms becomes necessary. The goal of pathfinding is to explore possible routes to get from one point, or node, to another, often with the goal of finding the quickest route. To get started, this sample demonstrates three common pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First, Best-First, and A* (A-Star). To illustrate the logic behind these algorithms, the searched nodes are represented as red dots, while the nodes available to search are represented as green dots. Once the algorithm has found the end, the tank travels the path to its destination.
