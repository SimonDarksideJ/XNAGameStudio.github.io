## Article Overview

Applications on mobile devices typically require low-friction entry and exit, allowing for quick and responsive experiences. Unlike console or PC games, where the user can invest hours in a single game session, use of applications on mobile devices is often on the order of seconds to minutes. Users can become frustrated when too much of these brief experiences is spent loading screens or performing other non-interactive activities.

To support this, the [Windows Phone Application Certification Requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9730558) provides requirements for responsiveness at launch time. This white paper discusses the intent of the requirements, as well as several best-practice techniques for reducing loading times.
