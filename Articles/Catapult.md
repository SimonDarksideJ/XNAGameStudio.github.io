## Description

Catapult is a complete XNA Game Studio game. The project comes ready to compile and run. It is easy to customize with a little bit of C# programming. You are free to use the source code as the basis for your own game projects, and to share your work with others.

The goal in Catapult is to send the pumpkin flying as far as possible. You do this by moving the catapult towards the log and launching the pumpkin. If you wait too long, the catapult smashes into the log and you have to try again. The all-time high score is kept in the upper-left corner. There are two ways to get boost power to help send your pumpkin flying. The first is to press the launch button close to the log. There are three levels of boost for launching close to the log. The boost level is shown by the number of exclamation points after the boost display is shown in the center of the screen shortly after launch. The other way to get boost power is to hold the right trigger on the gamepad at 50 percent or by pressing the B key on the keyboard.
