## Description

This sample demonstrates how to move objects along a heightmap. It is based on the [Generated Geometry](https://github.com/simondarksidej/XNAGameStudio/wiki/Generated_Geometry) sample, which creates a landscape from a bitmap. We build upon that sample, showing how to quickly calculate the height of any point on that heightmap.

## Sample Overview

The Generated Geometry sample introduced the concept of a heightmap. In that sample, a content processor reads a bitmap and uses the intensity of its pixels as height values on a terrain. A logical next step in this technique is to place objects on the terrain. This sample demonstrates that technique by placing a ball on the generated terrain.
