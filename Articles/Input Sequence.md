## Description

This sample shows how to detect sequences of input such as combo series, cheat codes, and other multi-button functions.

## Sample Overview

As the number of moves in a game increases, the number of buttons on the controller remains constant. Sequences and combinations of buttons can be used to represent a wider set of inputs than simply detecting which buttons are currently pressed. This sample contains the minimum logic required to detect simple input sequences. Fighting and action games can use this code as a starting point for a more advanced input subsystem. The code also draws input to the screen in a way that is useful for debugging and tweaking a game's controls.
