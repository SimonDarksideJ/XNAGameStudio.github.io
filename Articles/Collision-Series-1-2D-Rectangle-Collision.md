## Description

This tutorial details several simple techniques for constraining motion and collision detection in two dimensions.

## Tutorial Overview

Games don't need to be complex to be fun and interesting. Obstacle avoidance games consist of a character and some objects that are on a crash course towards each other. The player must avoid the oncoming objects.
