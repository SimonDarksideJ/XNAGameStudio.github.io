## Sample Overview

This starter kit is a dice game where the player rolls 5 dice in an attempt to create specific combinations. Included in this starter kit is support for a Wi-Fi multiplayer game over HTTP.

In Yacht, each player has 12 turns to score the most points possible. Points are scored by matching the dice you have rolled to specific combinations on the scoring sheet. Each turn, the active player has three rolls to create the highest scoring combination possible. Any number of dice can be held out for the second and third rolls, but after the third roll the player must choose a combination to score, even if the total for the combination is zero. At the end of 12 rounds, when all combinations have been scored, the player with the most points wins.
