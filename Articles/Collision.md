## Description

This sample shows how to test collision for all of the primitives found in the XNA Framework (Plane, Sphere, Ray, BoundingBox, BoundingFrustum) and also OrientedBoundingBox and Triangle. This sample is useful for any situation in which 3D collision is necessary.

## Sample Overview

This sample implements collision detection for primitives, including triangles and oriented-bounding boxes. It renders a scene that demonstrates collision detection for both these shapes and the XNA Framework's built-in geometric primitives.
