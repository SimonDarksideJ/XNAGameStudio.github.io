## Description

This sample demonstrates how to use information about a heightmap's vertex normals to follow the contour of the terrain.

## Sample Overview

The [Collision Series 4: Collision with a Heightmap](Collision-Series-4-Collision-with-a-Heightmap) sample demonstrated how to make a sphere roll around on a heightmap. One way to improve this is by orienting the object to follow the contour of the terrain. This sample provides a more believable effect for objects such as vehicles, which won't always be pointing the same way up as they move around.

This sample demonstrates how to do this by moving a tank around on a heightmap. The code involved is similar to the [Collision Series 4: Collision with a Heightmap](Collision-Series-4-Collision-with-a-Heightmap) sample, and throughout this sample it's assumed that you're familiar with that sample. In addition, you'll use the technique described in the [Simple Animation](Simple-Animation) sample to animate the tank.
