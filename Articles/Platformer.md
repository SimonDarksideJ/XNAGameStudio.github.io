## Sample Overview

This game, while functional, leaves room for expansion. Several non-essential features and systems aren't finished. This makes it easier and quicker to understand the structure of the game, and how the pieces fit together to provide a rich gaming experience.

Platformer includes the following features:

    Cross-platform support for Windows, Xbox 360, and Windows Phone 7.
    Control of the player character by using the keyboard or gamepad, or the accelerometer and touch on Windows Phone 7.
    Simple physics modeling (falling and jumping) and dynamic collision checking.
    Production-level sprite sheets, sound effects, and other game assets.
    High- and low-resolution assets, and an additional content project containing audio assets.
