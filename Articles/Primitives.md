## Description

This sample shows how to implement a PrimitiveBatch class, which can be used to easily draw points, lines, and triangles on the screen.

## Sample Overview

Many popular games use a "retro" style that does all of its drawing with points and lines. This sample shows how you can implement a PrimitiveBatch class that can be used to easily draw points, lines, and triangles on the screen. This functionality can be useful not only for drawing a game with a retro style, but also for debugging.
