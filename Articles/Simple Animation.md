## Description

This sample shows how to apply simple program-controlled rigid body animation to a model rendered by using the XNA Framework.

## Sample Overview

A tank model is loaded through the content pipeline, and then rendered by using a program-controlled animation. The wheels turn, the turret swivels back and forth, and the hatch opens and closes.
