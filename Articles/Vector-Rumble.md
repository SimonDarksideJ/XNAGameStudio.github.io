## Description

Vector Rumble is a complete XNA Game Studio mini-game. The project comes ready to compile and run. It is easy to customize with a little bit of C# programming. You are free to use the source code as the basis for your own game projects, and to share your work with others.

Vector Rumble is a two-dimensional shooter, pitting up to four players against one another in a death match arena filled with asteroids and power-ups.
