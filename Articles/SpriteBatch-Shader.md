## Description

The SpriteBatch shader represents the source code for the drawing functionality of the SpriteBatch object in the XNA Framework. It is provided as HLSL source code in a .fx file, along with an instructional document that describes the workings of the shader and how you can integrate it into your XNA Game Studio project.

## Utility Overview

This HLSL code is provided for educational purposes. It may be a useful starting point when you create more advanced shaders of your own. You can achieve many advanced graphical effects by using SpriteBatch alongside a custom pixel shader without needing to change the vertex shader. The vertex shader is heavily optimized for both Windows and Xbox 360 and may be more difficult to extend.
