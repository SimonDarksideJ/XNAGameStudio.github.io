## Description

This sample shows how to implement several simple behaviors for AI, including chasing, evading, and wandering.

## Sample Overview

This sample demonstrates chasing and evading behaviors by using three actorsâ€”a cat, a mouse, and a tank. The tank and the mouse are controlled by AI, and the cat is controlled by the player. The tank chases the cat, and the mouse runs from the cat. The tank and the mouse wander around the screen when the cat is not nearby. The "turn toward" functionality from the Aiming sample makes it very simple to create these behaviors: chase, evade, and wander.
